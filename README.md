# ENPM661

The script name is Project_One.py
The packages imported in the code are numpy, sys, and argparse
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the code:
1. To execute the script you can use this command in the Linux terminal window:
	
	python3 Project_One.py --testcase TestCaseX

	a. Where "X" in TestCaseX is the index of which test case you would like to run. 
	b. The command line argument is initiated by "--testcase".
	b. The acceptable options for the argument are TestCase1, TestCase2, TestCase3, TestCase4, or TestCase5

2. The script should not take long to complete, and the output will be sent to the NodePath.txt file in the same directory as the script.

3. The script will run only one testcase at a time, and the NodePath.txt file with results will overwrite every time.

4. As a note, in the output NodePath.txt file, "Our road map" is the parent-child map from initial to goal state.
